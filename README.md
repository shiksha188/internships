I obtained exposure in the following areas during a web development internship:

1. **HTML/CSS:** Using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to construct the structure and design of web pages.

2. **JavaScript:** Gaining an understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript, a computer language used to add interactivity and dynamic components to web sites.

3. **Front-end Frameworks:** Creating increasingly complicated and dynamic online apps using popular front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.

4. **Back-end Development:** Investigating server-side technologies like Node.js, PHP, Python, or Ruby on Rails to manage data, databases, and server-side logic.

5. **Version Control:** Understanding version control systems such as Git, which are critical for collaborating and managing code changes, is essential.
